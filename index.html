        <h2>Gwalior Fort</h2>
        <p>
            The Gwalior Fort (GwƒÅliiyar Qila) is a hill fort near Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, India. The fort has existed at least since the 10th century, and the inscriptions and monuments found within what is now the fort campus indicate that it may have existed as early as the beginning of the 6th century. The modern-day fort, consisting a defensive structure and two palaces was built by Tomar ruler Man Singh Tomar.[1] The fort has been controlled by a number of different rulers in its history.

    <h2>Taj-ul-Masajid Bhopal</h2>
    <p>
        The construction of the Taj-ul-Masajid was started by Nawab Shah Jahan Begum of Bhopal, in the newly-built walled suburb of Shahjahanabad. The exact year construction was started is unclear; Sharma estimates it to be 1871. After Shah Jahan Begum died in 1901, the mosque continued to be built by her daughter Sultan Jahan Begum, till the end of her lifetime. The structure was planned in the midst of three water bodies, namely: Munshi Hussain Talab; Noor Mahal Talab; and Motia Talab.
        <br>
        The Taj-ul-Masajid largely takes inspiration from Mughal architecture.

  <h2>Bahuti Waterfall</h2>
  <p>
    Bahuti is the highest waterfall in Madhya Pradesh. It is on the river Sellar as it rushes down the edge of the Valley of Mauganj to join the Bihad River, which is a tributary of Tamsa or Tons River. It is near Chachai Falls. It has a height of 198 metres (650 ft).
    <br>
    The Bahuti Falls is an example of a nick point caused by rejuvenation. Knick point, also called a nick point or simply nick, represents breaks in slopes in the longitudinal profile of a river caused by rejuvenation. The break in channel gradient allows water to fall vertically giving rise to a waterfall.
